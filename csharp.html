    <h2>C# Programming (see-sharp)</h2>
    <br>
    <p>C# is a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft as part of its.NET initiative, which is led by Anders Hejlsberg. This tutorial covers basic C# programming and various advanced concepts related to the C# programming language. C# programming is heavily based on the C and C++ programming languages, so if you have a basic understanding of C or C++ programming, learning C# will be a breeze.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>-overview-</h3>
    <br>
    <p>C# is a modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft and approved by European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and International Standards Organization (ISO). C# was developed by Anders Hejlsberg and his team during the development of the .Net Framework. C# is designed for Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), which consists of the executable code and runtime environment that allows the use of various high-level languages on different computer platforms and architectures.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>The following reasons make C# a widely used professional language:</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>It is a modern, general-purpose programming language.</li>
        <li>It is object-oriented.</li>
        <li>It is component-oriented.</li>
        <li>It is easy to learn.</li>
        <li>It is a fractured language.</li>
        <li>It produces efficient programs.</li>
        <li>It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms.</li>
        <li>It is part of the .Net Framework.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Although C# constructs closely follow traditional high-level languages, C and C++ and being an object-oriented programming languages. It has a strong resemblance with Java and has numerous strong programming features that make it endearing to a number of programmers worldwide.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Following is the list of a few important features of C#:</h3>

    <br>
    <p>C# is an object-oriented, component-oriented programming language. C# provides language constructs to directly support these concepts, making C# a natural language in which to create and use software components. Since its origin, C# has added features to support new workloads and emerging software design practices. At its core, C# is an object-oriented   language. You define types and their behavior.
        Several C# features help create robust and durable applications. Garbage collection automatically reclaims memory occupied by unreachable unused objects. Nullable types guard against variables that don't refer to allocated objects. Exception handling provides a structured and extensible approach to error detection and recovery. Lambda expressions support functional programming techniques. Language Integrated Query (LINQ) syntax creates a common pattern for working with data from any source. Language support for asynchronous operations provides a syntax for building distributed systems. C# has a unified type system. All C# types, including primitive types such as int and double, inherit from a single root object type. All types share a set of common operations. Values of any type can be stored, transported, and operated upon consistently. Furthermore, C# supports both user-defined reference types and value types. C# allows dynamic allocation of objects and in-line storage of lightweight structures. C# supports generic methods and types, which provide increased type safety and performance. C# provides iterators, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom behaviors for client code.
        C# emphasizes versioning to ensure programs and libraries can evolve compatible manner over time. Aspects of C#'s design that were directly influenced by versioning considerations include the separate virtual and override modifiers, the rules for method overload resolution, and support for explicit interface member declarations.

        <h3>advantages:</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>C# is purely object-oriented, but C++ is a combination of object-oriented and procedure-oriented.</li>
            <li>C# is type-safe.</li>
            <li>A programmer does not need to pay much concentration to problems such as memory loss, which is a worrying problem for the C++ programmer.</li>
            <li>The assembly concept resolves the issue of version control well.</li>
            <li>Easy to develop, the rich class library makes many functions easy to implement.</li>
            <li>Cross-platform. An application will run only if the .Net framework.</li>
            <li>Support for the distributed system.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>disadvantages:</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>A programmer cannot do low-level things like interacting directly with hardware through drivers and firmware.</li>
            <li>It does not come with an independent compiler that can straightforwardly interpret the maximum levels of language to the underlying hardware architecture of a pure assembler. It uses its byte code and the JIT compiler that is hugely incorporated into the .Net framework and is the backbone of the .Net structure as a go-between to the machine code in the place og communicating directly with the hardware.</li>
        </ul>
