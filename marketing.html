    <hr style="width: 100;" color="aqua">
    <br>
    <p>SEO marketing is a subset of digital marketing that entails optimizing websites and web pages for popular search engines such as Google. As search engines became the primary means of finding almost anything, a variety of practices have emerged to assist organizations in improving the visibility of their digital assets. Search engine optimization (SEO) refers to a combination of internal and external tactics. Each of the major search engines has its own formula or "secret sauce" for ranking pages in search results. These formulas, known technically as algorithms, are closely guarded practices that major search engines keep as trade secrets.</p>

    <h3><center>Why is SEO important for marketing?</center></h3>
    <br>
    <p>SEO is a fundamental part of digital marketing because people conduct trillions of searches every year, often with a commercial intent to find information about products and services. Search is often the primary source of digital traffic for brands and complements other marketing channels. Greater visibility and ranking higher in search results than your competition can have a material impact on your bottom line. However, search results have been evolving over the past few years to give users more direct answers and information that is more likely to keep users on the results page instead of driving them to other websites.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Search engine optimization (SEO) has both advantages and disadvantages. Although it’s considered one of the most important tools to rank higher with Google, there are downsides to SEO. Here are the pros and cons of SEO, brought to you by the SEO experts at Saba SEO, an industry-leading San Diego SEO company businesses rely on for high-quality service and unparalleled marketing expertise.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">DISADVANTAGES OF SEO MARKETING</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong style="color: peru;">Results are not instantaneous.</strong> You need patience and wait for the SEO to take effect. Search engine ranking and indexing can take anywhere from hours to weeks to do.</li>

    <li><strong style="color: peru;">SEO work can be expensive.</strong>  It costs to use proper SEO strategies. It may be money you can’t afford to spend.</li>
    <li><strong style="color: peru;">No guarantees.</strong> SEO is not a magic wand that will bring your customer son demand. You may not see any results.</li>
    <li><strong style="color: peru;">Rankings are lost.</strong> This may be due to changes in search engine and algorithm changes.</li>
    <li><strong style="color: peru;">Competition.</strong> Your competition may be smarter than you and a lot more aggressive.</li>
    <li><strong style="color: peru;">Too many unknowns.</strong> You may not have the SEO knowledge to handle every situation that arises with a website and SEO strategies.</li>
    <li><strong style="color: peru;">Paid positions.</strong> There are too many paid opportunities for businesses to use to boost their ranking over you and get a prime spot on the search results page.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<center><h3 style="border-style: solid; border-radius: 45px; border-color: #1cb45b; padding: 0; margin-top: 5%;">WHY DOES SEO MARKETING IMPORTANT?</h3></center>
<br>
<br>
<p style="text-indent: 0; font-size: 20px; text-transform: uppercase; color: peru;">SEO is important because:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The majority of search engine users (more than 70%  – see graph below) are more likely to click on one of the top 5 suggestions in the search engine results pages (SERPS). To take advantage of this and gain visitors to your website or customers to your online store, your website needs to appear in one of the top positions.</li>
    <li>SEO is not only about search engines but good SEO practices improve the user experience and usability of a website.</li>
    <li>Users trust search engines and having a presence in the top positions for the keywords the user is searching, increases the website’s trust.</li>
    <li>SEO is good for the social promotion of your website. People who find your website by searching Google or Bing are more likely to promote it on Facebook, Twitter, or other social media channels.</li>
    <li>SEO is important for the smooth running of a big website. Websites with more than one author can benefit from SEO in a direct and indirect ways. Their direct benefit is an increase in organic traffic and their indirect benefit is having a common framework (checklists) to use before publishing content on the site.</li>
    <li>SEO can put you ahead of the competition. If two websites are selling the same thing, the search engine optimized website is more likely to have more customers and make more sales.</li>
</ul>

<p>For beginners to SEO the above definition may sound complicated. In simpler terms, Search Engine Optimization is a way to improve your website so that it will appear closer to the top positions in the search results of Google, Yahoo, Bing, or other search engines. When you perform a search on Google the order by which the returning results are displayed, is based on complex algorithms. These algorithms (also known as search engine ranking factors) take into account a number of rules before they decide which webpage will be shown in the first position, second position, etc. Optimizing your website for search engines will give you an advantage over non-optimized sites and you increase your chances of ranking higher.</p>
