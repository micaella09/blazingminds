    <br>
    <p>The name PHP stands for <strong style="color: peru;">HYPERTEXT PREPROCESSOR</strong> and denotes a server-side scripting language, which suggests that applications are written thereon run on web servers and don’t depend upon the online browser. Syntax of PHP language is analogous to C language. It is created by Rasmus Lerdorf and appeared in 1995. PHP is being widely utilized in developing web applications and became one of the main languages for developers to make new applications.</p><br>
    <p>Leading social networking sites like Facebook and reputed organizations like Harvard University are both using PHP which makes PHP popular and increases its credibility.</p><br>
    <p>However, over years, its area of use has shifted, and nowadays PHP coding language is ranked among the simplest and hottest programming tools for web development thanks to its many virtues which can be the main target of this text. It’s considered a really effective technology that gives a convenient development process with many additional tools to assist it. In fact, consistent with recognition of programming language Index (PYPL), PHP is the fifth hottest coding language in the world.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 3%;"><center>HISTORY OF THE LANGUAGE</center></h3>
        <br>
        <p>Originally (it is believed) the letters stood for Personal Home Page. The first work was done by Rasmus Lerdorf and dates back to about 1994. Lerdorf originally used it for his personal page – specifically to track visitors. Soon, a lot of additional functions were added. It took a few years, though, for it to become a language and not just a set of tools. The code was released in the mid-1990s. <strong>Israel’s Andi Gutmans and Zeev Suraski</strong> did a major overhaul in 1997 with the goal of using PHP to run an eCommerce site. Their version, termed PHP 3.0, had more of the features we expect and see today.</p><br><br>
        <p style="margin-top: 3%;">The same duo later created Version 4.0. 2004 saw another major revision, PHP 5.0. Although there has not yet been a 6.0, there have been significant improvements since 5.0, including the removal of several things that had caused instability or potential security breaches.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Though PHP is undoubtedly useful in the field of web development, it also has several disadvantages that prevent it from dominating that area. It is not that secure due to its open-source, because the ASCII text file is often easily available. It’s highly tough to manage because it’s not competent modular. It already imitates the features of the Java language. The PHP frameworks aren’t equivalent in behavior so does their performance and features, and it is widely believed by the developers that PHP features a poor quality of handling errors. PHP lacks debugging tools, which are needed to look for errors and warnings. PHP has less number of debugging tools in comparison to other programming languages. </p>
