    <br>
    <h3><center>WHAT IS PROGRAMMING?</center></h3>
    <br>
    <p><strong style="color: peru;">Programming</strong> refers to the process of writing a computer program, which is a set of instructions that a computer executes to get the required result. Web development is the process of creating any kind of web application or website. Programming and web development describe similar areas of expertise, but they are not the same. If you are looking to start a career in these fields, then you should know the differences between these two closely related terms. In this article on programming vs web development, we will understand the meaning of each term and discuss the differences between them.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Programming is the act of providing computers with a set of instructions (computer program) that direct them to do a specified task and produce the expected results. A computer program is a code or a sequence of instructions written using a programming language that is executed on a computer to perform particular tasks. Programming is used for creating applications. Computer programs are written by programmers. They use many different programming languages such as Java, Python, JavaScript, and C++ to instruct computers. Programmers are responsible for converting convert problem solutions into instructions for the computer.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="create">
    <p style="color: peru;">They create instructions for computers, run the instructions on the computer, tests the program and check if it is working properly, and make changes to the program. In general, programmers follow the below steps to develop a program:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Define the goal of the application.</li>
        <li>Plan a layout of the different parts of the program.</li>
        <li>Write code.</li>
        <li>Debug the code.</li>
        <li>Test the program.</li>
        <li>Releasing the program to beta users</li>
        <li>Write a report on the program.</li>
    </ul>

<h3><center>Popular Programming Languages</center></h3>
<p>Programming languages are used to communicate with computers and give them instructions. Some of the commonly used programming languages are given below:</p>
<br>
<div class="custom-list">
<ul>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>C</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>C++</li>

<h3><center>WHAT IS WEB DEVELOPMENT?</center></h3>
<br>
<p><strong style="color: peru;">Web Development</strong> refers to developing and maintaining websites. It includes different aspects such as web design, web programming, and database management. Web development involves the tasks that take place behind the scenes to make a website look great, work fast, and offer a smooth user experience.</p>
<br>
 <img src="https://freepngimg.com/save/19590-web-development-download-png/446x392" width="46%" height="50%" style="float: left; margin-right: 50px; margin-bottom: 55px; margin-top: 3%;">
 <br>
 <p style="text-indent: 0; color: peru;">Web Development can be categorized into:</p>
 <br>
 <ul>
    <li><strong>Frontend Development.</strong>  Frontend development is also called the ‘client side’ of the application. It is the part of a website that the user interacts with directly. Frontend developers convert the available data into a graphical user interface using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.</li>
    <li><strong>Backend Development.</strong> Also called the server-side of application, the backend development is focused on that part of any web page that users can’t see. Backend developers store and organize data while also ensuring the proper functioning of everything available on the frontend.</li>
    <li><strong>Fullstack Development.</strong> Fullstack development involves both the front-end and the back-end development. Full-stack developers take care of the development of the design of the web page as well as managing the database for data organization and storage.</li>
 </ul>

 <h3><center>What's the difference between development and programming?</center></h3>
 <br>
<center><img src="https://www.freelancinggig.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Good-Programmer-and-Graphic-Designer-at-the-Same-Time.png" width="45%" height="45%" style="margin-bottom: 2%;"></center>
<p>Web development is a broad term that can refer to coding, but also includes other activities such as planning, managing projects, etc. It's the process of building something from start to finish. In contrast, programming specifically refers to writing code. This is the confusing part. If a programmer can write the code that runs a website, doesn't that mean they are also a developer? The short answer is no, because there are different kinds of code that combine to run a website. The two areas of code are referred to as front end development and back end development.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<div class="create">
    <p style="color: #1cb45b;">In today's Web development, a good page design is essential. A bad design will lead to the loss of visitors and that can lead to a loss of business. In general, a good page layout has to satisfy the basic elements of a good page design. This includes color contrast, text organization, font selection, style of a page, page size, graphics used, and consistency. In order to create a well-designed page for a specific audience. The developer needs to organized and analyze the users' statistics and the background of the users. Although it can be hard to come up with a design that is well suited to all of the users, there will be a design that is appropriate for most of the audience. The better the page design, the more hits a page will get. That implies an increase in accessibility and a possible increase in business.</p>
