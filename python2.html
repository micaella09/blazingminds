    <br>
    <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics developed by Guido van Rossum. It was originally released in 1991. Designed to be easy as well as fun, the name "Python" is a nod to the British comedy group Monty Python. Python has a reputation as a beginner-friendly language, replacing Java as the most widely used introductory language because it handles much of the complexity for the user, allowing beginners to focus on fully grasping programming concepts rather than minute details.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Python is used for server-side web development, software development, mathematics, and system scripting, and is popular for Rapid Application Development and as a scripting or glue language to tie existing components because of its high-level, built-in data structures, dynamic typing, and dynamic binding. Program maintenance costs are reduced with Python due to the easily learned syntax and emphasis on readability. Additionally, Python's support of modules and packages facilitates modular programs and reuse of code. Python is an open source community language, so numerous independent programmers are continually building libraries and functionality for it.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><center>History of Python</center></h3>
    <br>
    <p>Python is a widely-used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was initially designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.</p><br>
    <p>In the late 1980s, history was about to be written. It was that time when working on Python started. Soon after that, Guido Van Rossum began doing its application-based work in December of 1989 at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) which is situated in the Netherlands. It was started firstly as a hobby project because he was looking for an interesting project to keep him occupied during Christmas. The programming language in which Python is said to have succeeded is ABC Programming Language, which had interfacing with the Amoeba Operating System and had the feature of exception handling. He had already helped to create ABC earlier in his career and he had seen some issues with ABC but liked most of the features. After that what he did was really very clever. He had taken the syntax of ABC, and some of its good features. It came with a lot of complaints too, so he fixed those issues completely and had created a good scripting language that had removed all the flaws. The inspiration for the name came from BBC’s TV Show – ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus’, as he was a big fan of the TV show and also he wanted a short, unique and slightly mysterious name for his invention and hence he named it Python! He was the “Benevolent dictator for life” (BDFL) until he stepped down from the position as the leader on 12th July 2018. For quite some time he used to work for Google, but currently, he is working at Dropbox</p><br>
    <p>The language was finally released in 1991. When it was released, it used a lot fewer codes to express the concepts, when we compare it with Java, C++ & C. Its design philosophy was quite good too. Its main objective is to provide code readability and advanced developer productivity. When it was released it had more than enough capability to provide classes with inheritance, several core data types exception handling and functions.</p>

<br>
<p>Python is consistently rated as one of the world's most popular programming languages. Python is fairly easy to learn, so if you are starting to learn any programming language then Python could be your great choice. Today various Schools, Colleges and Universities are teaching Python as their primary programming language.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3 style="margin-top: 3%;"><center>Benefits of Learning Python</center></h3>
<br>
<ul>
    <li><strong style="color: peru;">Python Increases Your Earning Potential.</strong> According to the observations of many job portals such as Indeed, Python is the second-highest paid computer language. You can expect an average salary of USD 110,026 per year. The possibility of your earning potential increases, if you can land a job with one of the top companies in the world.</li><br>
    <li><strong style="color: peru;">Ease of Learning and Fun To Use.</strong> One of the top benefits of leaning Python is that it is easy to learn and fun to use. Its syntax reads like English, so it is easy to learn when compared with other programming languages. Python was named after Monty Python’s Flying Circus, which is BBC's sketch comedy programme from the Monty Python comedy team. If you have ever watched their series, you know someone had a sense of humor developing this code and thus made it simple to use. On top of it all, Python is free and open-sourced.</li><br>
    <li><strong style="color: peru;">Flexible To Use.</strong> Python is called a flexible programming language because it has over 125,000 third-party libraries which enable you to use Python for machine learning, web processing, and even scientific purposes. Python is a highly preferred programming language for data analysis. Its data-focused libraries, like NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib, make it very capable of processing, manipulating, and visualizing data. </li><br>
    <li><strong style="color: peru;">Industry-wide Applications.</strong> Python is used across many industries and you can its application in any industry, such as Web Development, Web development, Computer graphics, Finance and trading, Basic game development, Security and penetration testing, System automation and administration, Mapping and geography (GIS software), Scientific and mathematical computing, and General and application-specific scripting.</li><br>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<p style="color: peru; font-size: 20px;">In this blog on the ‘Advantages and Disadvantages of Python,’ you will first learn about some of the significant advantages of the Python programming language.</p>
<br>
<ol>
    <li><strong style="color: peru;">Easy-to-learn and Easy-to-use. </strong>Python programming language has a syntax similar to the English language, making it extremely easy and simple for anyone to read and understand its codes. You can pick up this language without much trouble and learn it easily.</li><br>
    <li><strong style="color: peru;">Improves Productivity. </strong>Another one of Python’s benefits is that it is an extremely productive language, and because of its simplicity, Python Programmers can easily focus on solving issues.</li><br>
    <li><strong style="color: peru;">Interpreted Language. </strong>Python, being an interpreted language, can execute the code directly, one line after the other. Moreover, if there is any error, then rather than continuing with further execution, it instead reports back the error that occurred.</li>
    <li><strong style="color: peru;">Open-source. </strong>Python has an open-source license and is available for users for free, allowing you to easily distribute it. With Python, you can download any source code and further modify and distribute your version of the code in Python. This feature can come in handy especially when you wish to reuse the code and save time to build innovative applications. Besides, you can change its behavior and use the older version of code for development.</li><br>
    <li><strong style="color: peru;">Easily Portable. </strong>In most languages, including the ones you have learned to read, write, and use such as C, C++, etc., you need to make changes in the code to run a given program on distinct platforms. However, that is not the case with Python programming. In Python, you need to write the code only once, and you can run it on any platform, adapting the ‘write once, run anywhere’ feature. Although, you need to make sure that you do not involve any features that are system-dependent.</li><br>
    <li><strong style="color: peru;">Massive Libraries. </strong>Python’s standard library is vast, and herein, you can find all the necessary functions you require for any given task. This makes Python independent of external libraries. Although, if you do wish to use some external libraries, then with the Python package manage (pip), you can easily import several packages from the massive Python Package Index (PyPi), containing more than 200,000 packages. </li><br>
    <li><strong style="color: peru;">Easy-to-integrate with Other Programming Languages. </strong>Python has another unique feature that allows it to integrate not only with libraries, such as Jython and Cython, but also with other programming languages, including Java, C, and C++ for cross-platform development. Therefore, Python is comparatively more powerful. No programming language is complete, and it is not generally advisable to use one language for all applications and developments. Besides, similar to every other language, Python’s forte is to provide you a massive library so that you can enjoy strong and powerful features of other languages as well.</li>
</ol>

<br>
<h3 style="margin-top: 3%;"><center>Disadvantages of Python</center></h3>
<br>
<p>You have read in detail about the numerous advantages of Python programming language. Although its advantages indeed overweigh its disadvantages, Python does have a few disadvantages that you should know. Now, it is time to learn about them.</p>
<br>
<ol>
    <li><strong style="color: peru;">Low Speed. </strong>Strengths can, unfortunately, lead to some weaknesses at times. Here is such a case. Yes, Python is a dynamically-typed and interpreted language, but this means that the code is executed line-by-line, further leading to its slow execution. Python’s dynamic nature is mainly the reason for its low speed since there is a requirement for some extra work during the execution process. This is one of the reasons why Python is not used when speed is a significant aspect of a given program.</li><br>
    <li><strong style="color: peru;">Inefficient Memory Consumption. </strong>To offer some simplicity to programmers and developers, Python needs to make some tradeoffs. This language uses a huge amount of memory, which acts as a disadvantage, especially when you are developing an app with a preference for memory optimization.</li><br>
    <li><strong style="color: peru;">Weak in Programming for Mobile Devices. </strong>Developers usually use Python for server-side programming, rather than using it for mobile applications or client-side programming. This is because Python has the slow processing power and is hardly memory efficient when compared to other programming languages.</li><br>
    <li><strong style="color: peru;">Difficult-to-Interact Database Layer. </strong>It is significantly stress-free and easy to code a program using Python, but when it comes to interacting with the database, Python lags behind. It has an underdeveloped and primitive database layer in contrast to other more popular technologies such as ODBC and JDBC. Mostly, companies aim to have smooth interaction with complex data, which makes it difficult for them to use Python.</li><br>
    <li><strong style="color: peru;">Prone to Cause Runtime Errors. </strong>Python’s dynamic feature allows it to change a variable’s data type at any time. A Python variable that once held an integer value, may hold a string value in the future. This may lead to runtime errors. Hence, developers must perform several rounds of testing for any application developed.</li>
</ol>

<div class="create">
    <p style="color: #1cb45b;">Understanding the syntax of Python is great and all, and Python by itself is indeed a great language, but the fundamentals of Python aren't why Python is a successful language. There are plenty of fun-to-write languages that are just like Python, such as Ruby, Julia, even R.</p>
