<h3 style="text-align: center;">An overview of email history</h3>
<p>Ray Tomlinson, a computer engineer, sent the first email in 1971. The message he sent was simply a series of numbers and letters, but it signaled the start of a new era of communication. Tomlinson was also the first person to use the "@" symbol in email addresses. In 1978, Gary Thuerk, a marketing manager at Digital Equipment Corp, used this new method of direct communication to send out the first commercial email to inform people about a new product. By the 1990s, the internet was commercially available to the general public. People's communication styles began to shift dramatically, and marketers discovered that email could be an effective medium for advertising.</p>
<p>In 1978, the first email marketing blast was sent (Source). The sender was Gary Thuerk, a Digital Equipment Corp. employee. His email blast to 400 recipients was intended to promote his company's computers, and it resulted in $13 million in sales.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong style="color: peru;">Unrivalled return on investment.</strong> Results are arguably all that matters in business. With this in mind, the fantastic return on investment is the primary reason that most businesses invest in email marketing. Email has a return on investment of £35 for every £1 spent, according to the DMA.</li><br>
  <li><strong style="color: peru;">Instant impact.</strong> Because of the immediacy of email, a business can begin seeing results within minutes of sending its emails. A 24-hour sale is an excellent marketing strategy that can be used via email because it creates a sense of urgency and persuades subscribers to take immediate action.</li><br>
  <li><strong style="color: peru;">Reach a global audience.</strong> What other marketing platform allows you to send a message to thousands of people all over the world in real time? Sure, social media can help you reach a global audience, but you never know who is actually reading your content.</li><br>
  <li><strong style="color: peru;">Easy to share.</strong> With the click of a button, subscribers can forward fantastic deals and offers to their friends. There aren't many other types of marketing that are as easily shared as this. Subscribers may soon become brand evangelists, focused on introducing your company to a new market.</li><br>
  <li><strong style="color: peru;">Easy to measure.</strong> Another significant advantage of email marketing is that it is simple to identify where you are going wrong. Most email marketing software will allow you to track open, click-through, and conversion rates, making it simple to determine how to improve a campaign.</li><br>
  <li><strong style="color: peru;">Easy to get started.</strong> In order to be effective, email marketing doesn't necessary need a sizable team or tons of technological know-how. You can definitely dress up an email campaign with glitzy templates, videos, graphics, and logos. However, some of the most effective campaigns use straightforward plain text emails, indicating that the most crucial factor in an email is its content.</li><br>

  <li><strong style="color: peru;">Deliver targeted messages.</strong> The majority of marketing professionals would gladly pay to guarantee that their advertising dollars were solely directed to customers who were interested in their brand. However, email marketers can take it a step further by limiting the recipients of their communications to those who satisfy specific requirements.</li><br>
  <li><strong style="color: peru;">Reach an already engaged audience.</strong> One of the few marketing methods that customers specifically request is email. The vast majority of businesses that use the platform solely communicate with subscribers. Due to the fact that a business is only focusing on customers who are already interested in their brand, conversion rates can be significantly greater as a result.</li><br>
  <li><strong style="color: peru;">Low costs.</strong> One of email marketing's most evident benefits is that it is less expensive than other types of marketing. For visibility on a particular billboard, magazine, or television channel, there are no printing, postage, or other fees to pay. To automate, track, and assess their mailings, email marketers can think about investing in specialized software.</li>
