    <p>HTML or Hypertext Markup Language is a standard choice utilized for the building of websites, web pages and web-based applications.

It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. His browsers then display the content wrapped inside the body tag.HTML defines the format of how the web elements should be displayed. To see your content, you need to save your file with. Html or.htm extension and then simply run it by choosing the option to open with any browser. HTML is one of the best options to develop a webpage or website for a small or growing business that does not want to invest more in purchasing software or its license and does not require any advanced programming for their websites.</p>
