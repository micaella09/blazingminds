    <p>High-performance apps can be made using the cross-platform language C++. Bjarne Stroustrup created C++ as an addition to the C language. Programmers have extensive control over memory and system resources thanks to C++. In 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020, there were four significant updates to the language, resulting in C++11, C++14, C++17, and C++20. One of the most widely used programming languages worldwide is C++. Operating systems, graphical user interfaces, and embedded systems all use C++ today. Programming in C++, an object-oriented language, offers applications a distinct structure and encourages code reuse, which reduces development costs. C++ is portable and can be used to design apps that can be converted to many platforms.</p><br>
    <p>The C++ programming language provides a model of memory and computation that closely matches that of most computers. In addition, it provides powerful and flexible mechanisms for abstraction; that is, language constructs that allow the programmer to introduce and use new types of objects that match the concepts of an application. Thus, C++ supports styles of programming that rely on fairly direct manipulation of hardware resources to deliver a high degree of efficiency plus higher-level styles of programming that rely on user-defined types to provide a model of data and computation that is closer to a human’s view of the task being performed by a computer. These higher-level styles of programming are often called data abstraction, object-oriented programming, and generic programming.</p>

    <br>
    <p style="color: peru; font-size: 20px; text-indent: 0; text-align: center;">This paper is organized around the main programming styles directly supported by C++:</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>The Design and Evolution of C++ describes the aims of C++ and the principles that guided its evolution.</li><br>
        <li>The C Programming Model presents the C subset of C++ and other C++ facilities supporting traditional systems-programming styles.</li><br>
        <li>The C++ Abstraction Mechanisms introduces C++’s class concept and its use for defining new types that can be used exactly as built-in types show how abstract classes can be used to provide interfaces to objects of a variety of types describes the use of class hierarchies in object-oriented programming, and presents templates in support of generic programming.</li><br>
        <li>Large-Scale Programming describes namespaces and exception handling provided to ease the composition of programs out of separate parts.</li><br>
        <li>6 The C++ Standard Library presents standard facilities such as I/O streams, strings, containers (e.g. vector, list, and map), generic algorithms (e.g. sort (), find(), for each()), and support for numeric computation.</li><br>
    </ul>

    <p>C++ was designed and implemented by Bjarne Stroustrup (the author of this article) at AT&T Bell Laboratories to combine the organizational and design strengths of Simula with C’s facilities for systems programming. The initial version of C++ called ‘‘C with Classes’’ [Stroustrup,1980], was first used in 1980; it supported traditional system programming techniques (§3) and data abstraction (§4.1). The basic facilities for object-oriented programming (§4.2-4.3) were added in 1983 and object-oriented design and programming techniques were gradually introduced into the C++ community. The language was first made commercially available in 1985 [Stroustrup,1986] [Stroustrup,1986b]. Facilities for generic programming were added to the language in the 1987-1989 time frame [Ellis,1990] [Stroustrup,1991].</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>As the result of widespread use and the appearance of several independently-developed C++ implementations, formal standardization of C++ started in 1990 under the auspices of the American National Standards Institute, ANSI, and later the International Standards Organization, ISO, leading to an international standard in 1998 [C++,1998]. During the period of standardization, the standards committee acted as an important focus for the C++ community and its draft standards acted as interim definitions of the language. As an active member of the standards committee, I was a key participant in the further evolution of C++. Standard C++ is a better approximation to my ideals for C++ than were earlier versions. The design and evolution of C++ are documented in [Stroustrup, 1994] [Stroustrup, 1996] and [Stroustrup, 1997b]. The language as it is defined at the end of the standardization process and the key design and programming techniques it directly supports are presented in [Stroustrup, 1997].</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 2%;">Similar benefits to those of C apply to C++, but with greater functionality. Because of its steep learning curve, C++ is less approachable for new programmers. Big applications should not be written in C++, but a small to medium sized applications can be written in C++ for added speed and scalability.</p>
