    <h2>WEB DESIGN</h2>
    <hr style="width: 100;" color="aqua">
    <br>
    <P>Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important.</P>
    <br>
    <center><img src="https://www.cloudways.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/20-Best-Web-Design-Tools-for-Design-Agencies.jpg" alt="If you think good design is expensive, you should look at the cost of bad design." width="50%" height="50%"></center>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Web design is a Web development process that focuses on aesthetic factors such as layout, user interface, and other visual imagery to make a website more visually appealing and easy to use. To achieve the desired look, web designers use a variety of programs and tools, including Dreamweaver, Photoshop, and others. Web designers must consider their audience, the purpose of the website, and the visual appeal of the design when creating a winning design.</p>
    <p>The majority of websites are created using a coding language known as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). To be displayed successfully on the client browser, a website must adhere to the rules of this language. HTML tags are used to identify the content of a website on each page. The overall visual appearance of each page is then defined using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). The outcome is determined by the combination of these elements. Because hand coding can be exhausting for some designers, some prefer to use programs such as Adobe Dreamweaver.</p>
    <p>A web designer is responsible for a website's look, feel, and occasionally even content. For instance, appearance refers to the colors, text, and images utilized. Information's organization and categorization are referred to as its layout. An effective web design is user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing, and appropriate for the target audience and brand of the website. Many websites focus on keeping things simple so that viewers won't be distracted or confused by additional information and functionality. Removing as many potential sources of user annoyance as possible is a crucial factor to take into account because the foundation of a web designer's output is a site that gains and nurtures the trust of the target audience.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Responsive and adaptive design are two of the most popular techniques for creating websites that function well on both desktop and mobile devices. In adaptive design, the website content is fixed in layout sizes that correspond to typical screen sizes, while in responsive design, information moves dynamically based on screen size. A layout that is as consistent as possible across devices is essential to preserving user engagement and trust. Designers must be cautious when giving up control of how their work will appear because responsive design can be challenging in this area. While they might need to diversify their skill set if they are also in charge of the content, they will benefit from having complete control over the final output.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>WHY IS WEB DESIGN IMPORTANT?</h3>
<p>A successful website is one that converts visitors. The term "convert" on the web refers to persuading a user to perform a particular activity. Your website made a conversion when a user completes an action that it invited them to take. Conversions can take many different forms, including newsletter subscriptions, purchases, account creation, and access to more website material.</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Compelling use of negative space</li>
    <li>Clearly presented choices for the user (the fewer choices the user has, the less likely they are to become overwhelmed and confused)</li>
    <li>Obvious, clear calls to action</li>
    <li>Limited distractions and a well thought out user journey (ie. using only images and text that are 100% relevant to the subject on the page, featuring only buttons that lead to desired actions and using font variations for emphasis and calls to action, not just for the sake of featuring different fonts)</li>
    <li>Responsive design (a design that resizes and reorients itself to the user’s screen, making the website easy to use on any device: phone, tablet, laptop or desktop browser.</li>
    <li>Appropriately sized fonts that follow a hierarchy (see “Limited distractions”)</li>
    <li>Relevant, high-quality content and images that hook your readers’ attention</li>
    <li>A balance between the amount of text and images on each page (too much text can overwhelm a visitor, too little text can be equally disengaging)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h3>What doesn't work in website design</h3>
<img src="https://savvyify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tips-for-creative-web-designer.jpg" width="45%" height="45%" style="float: right; margin-left: 50px;">
<p>Generally speaking, users of your website shouldn't have to exert any effort. Your website should be simple to use and intuitive throughout the whole browsing experience.<br>
    Here are a few illustrations: Unambiguous invitations to action are a hallmark of poor site design. Low contrast, difficult-to-read typefaces are poor web design; high contrast, effective fonts are.</p>
    <p>Here are a few other elements to avoid:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Distracting images and backgrounds. </strong>Keep away from tiled backgrounds in general. Though there are a few specific situations in which a tiled background might be a wise choice, they are typically distracting.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-responsive design. </strong>Nowadays your website simply needs to be mobile responsive.</li>
        <li><strong>Unclear links and buttons. </strong>Visitors should be able to quickly identify the images and text that will direct them to new pages or confirm their selections without having to search for links and buttons. Users should also be able to easily identify fillable fields.</li>
        <li><strong>Generic or irrelevant stock photos and filler text without valuable information. </strong></li>
    </ul>
<br>
<h4><i>"Your website should be designed with your target audience in mind, and it should improve user experience."</i></h4>
<p>Your website is one of the most important aspects of your brand's online presence, and it must be properly designed. Your website is also where you nurture your bottom-of-the-funnel leads in order to convert them. As a result, you cannot afford any website failures that may cause your prospects to leave your website. Your website should be designed with your target audience in mind, and it should provide a good user experience. There are numerous other advantages to having a good website design for both your business and your audience.</p>
