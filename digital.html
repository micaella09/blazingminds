    <h2>DIGITAL MARKETING</h2>
    <hr style="width: 100;" color="aqua">
    <br>
    <P>Digital marketing, the technique of advertising a firm through online channels including search, social, sponsored, and email, offers a strong and affordable means to increase revenue. Read on to discover more about what digital marketing is and how to use it to your business.</P>
    <br>
    <center><img src="https://img.freepik.com/premium-photo/digital-design-businessman-show-increase-market-graphic_35761-546.jpg?w=2000" width="50%" height="50%"></center>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Digital marketing is the marketing and advertising of a business, person, product, or service using online channels, electronic devices, and digital technologies. A few examples of digital marketing include social media, email, pay-per-click (PPC), search engine optimization (SEO), and more.</p>
    <p>Online marketing is effective when you create a coordinated, multi-channel approach that supports the distinct buying journey of your target group. This means that your company employs a variety of platforms, including social media, email, and search, to support a larger marketing strategy, such as producing leads, sales, or brand awareness.</p>
    <p>Digital marketing, also known as online marketing, refers to advertising delivered through digital channels to promote brands and connect potential customers using the internet and other forms of digital communication such as: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Search engines</li>
      <li>Websites</li>
      <li>Social Media</li>
      <li>Email</li>
      <li>Mobile Apps</li>
      <li>Text Messaging</li>
      <li>Web-based advertising</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>In a nutshell, digital marketing is any marketing effort that makes use of any of the aforementioned online media outlets. Today's consumers conduct a lot of their product research online. According to HubSpot Research, 77% of consumers look up a brand online before connecting with it. While 51% of shoppers claim to research products on Google before making a purchase.</p>
<br>
<h3>How does digital marketing work?</h3>
<p>Marketers must delve deeply into today's huge and complex cross-channel world to find tactics that have an impact through engagement marketing if they are to realize the full potential of digital marketing. Engagement marketing refers to the process of developing meaningful relationships with prospective and recurring customers based on the data you gather over time. By engaging customers in the digital sphere, you increase brand recognition, establish yourself as a thought leader, and put your company in the spotlight when the client is prepared to make a purchase.</p>
<p>Digital marketing uses a range of strategies to reach customers, whether the aim is to tempt them into making a purchase, increase their brand awareness, or simply engage with your brand. Modern digital marketing comprises a broad system of channels, including: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Social media</li>
    <li>Content marketing</li>
    <li>Website marketing</li>
    <li>SEO (search engine optimization)</li>
    <li>PPC (pay per click) advertising</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Why is digital marketing important?</h3>
<img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1025744816/photo/digital-online-marketing-commerce-sale-concept-woman-using-tablet-payments-online-shopping.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=vGRODnnq_lPTnRZXYLxXMdW1k6Q2kQLZylOLJg6UHz4=" width="45%" height="45%" style="float: right; margin-left: 50px;">
<p>Marketers can gain valuable insights into target audience behaviors while also opening the door to new methods of customer engagement by implementing an omnichannel digital marketing strategy. Companies can also expect an increase in retention. According to an Invesp report, companies with strong omnichannel customer engagement strategies keep 89% of their customers. In comparison, companies with poor omnichannel programs have a 33% retention rate.<br></p>
<p>Digital marketing is still evolving. For example, the growing number of wearable devices available to consumers opens up new avenues for marketing to them. According to Forbes, social media in the B2B space will become more conversational, video content will be refined for search engine optimization (SEO), and email marketing will become even more personalized.</p>
<br>
<p style="color: peru; font-size: 20px; text-indent: 0;">For companies today, digital marketing matters because it offers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple online marketing strategies.</li>
  <li>Cost-effective marketing solutions.</li>
  <li>Level playing field.</li>
  <li>Advanced targeting and personalization options.</li>
  <li>Accurate campaign tracking and measurement.</li>
  <li>Continuous campaign performance feedback.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">How is digital marketing different from traditional marketing?</h3>
<img src="https://us.123rf.com/450wm/pitinan/pitinan2004/pitinan200400172/pitinan200400172.jpg?ver=6" width="45%" height="45%" style="float: left; margin-right: 50px;">
<p>The distinction between traditional and digital marketing is straightforward. Traditional marketing employs offline channels, whereas digital marketing employs online channels. A traditional marketing campaign, for example, might use billboards, print ads, and mailers, whereas a digital marketing campaign might promote a business and its offerings through social media, blog posts, and email. The distinction between "traditional marketing" and "digital marketing" has begun to blur in recent years, as even traditional channels such as billboards, TV ads, and direct mail have developed a digital component.</p>
<p>Of course, just because something is traditional doesn't imply it's outdated. With the increasing necessity for people to leave the digital environment, traditional marketing continues to be significant in people's lives. Because of their enduring impacts on your memory, an effective TV commercial and the tactile feel of a copy of Rolling Stone magazine are just as significant today as they were 20 years ago. You unconsciously emotionally identify with their brand, which keeps them at the forefront of your mind. Likewise, digital marketing is just as significant as traditional marketing, if not more so. Digital marketing uses every touch point of your daily use of the internet to reach you.</p>
<br>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">The benefits of digital marketing.</h3>
<p>Digital marketing can assist you in getting to know your audience, learning important information about them, and providing metrics that will lend credibility to your marketing team. The following are some of the advantages of digital marketing:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong style="color: peru;">You will get to know your audience.</strong> Digital marketing is an excellent way to get to know and connect with your target audience. You can test offers and messages and learn when people are most likely to visit your website. If you have a social media strategy, which you should, you can build relationships with them more quickly and easily. When you pay attention to your audience, you will gain credibility that will set you apart from the competition.</li>
  <li><strong  style="color: peru;">It doesn’t cost much.</strong> Digital marketing is less expensive than conventional marketing strategies. Less expenses are incurred. Using one of the many templated systems or spending more for a custom design, you can create a polished, professional website for a fair price. You can partner with an email newsletter provider for a reasonable cost and create social media accounts for free. Relatively cost-effective, digital marketing is suitable for even the smallest of businesses.</li>
  <li><strong  style="color: peru;">You can market to anyone, anywhere.</strong> The potential audience for digital marketing is enormous. In many time zones, a company may communicate with clients just as easily as when you're placing an advertisement in a neighborhood paper (easier, in fact). The market reach can be increased, and the company can expand in ways that previously seemed inconceivable.</li>
  <li><strong  style="color: peru;">Digital marketing is adaptable.</strong> Digital marketing allows you to be quick, adaptable, and nimble in your approach. Try out various approaches, evaluate the results, and try something new the next week or month. Get real-time data access to assist in guiding your company decisions; there is no need to wait weeks to discover the outcomes of a campaign.</li>
  <li><strong  style="color: peru;">You can personalize by channel.</strong> For company marketing to reach clients where they are at that particular moment, cross-channel capabilities from teams with diverse skill sets is required. For instance, the consumers and expectations on each social media site vary, so marketing may seem different on each. This covers the post's tone, images, offers, and timing.</li>
  <li><strong  style="color: peru;">You can measure campaigns and set KPIs.</strong> The efficacy of business marketing can be assessed using a wide range of measures supported by digital marketing. Setting business goals and desired metrics for each channel should come first. This may monitor the number of leads and conversions, website views, and much more, offering businesses a wealth of useful information to advance their company.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p style="border-style: solid; border-radius: 35px; padding: 1em; color: aqua;" >Both forms of marketing ultimately have advantages and disadvantages, but the trick is to understand your unique marketing requirements, take your budget into account, and comprehend your target demographic.</p>
