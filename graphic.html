    <h3><center>WHAT IS GRAPHIC DESIGN?</center></h3>
    <p>Graphic design, as defined by the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA), is "the art and practice of planning and projecting ideas and experiences with visual and textual content." In other words, graphic design communicates ideas or messages visually. These visuals can be as simple as a company logo or as complex as website page layouts.</p>
    <p>When asked to define graphic design, designer Alexandros Clufetos says, "Graphic design takes graphical and textual elements and implements them into multiple types of media." "It allows the producer to connect with the consumer." It conveys the message of the project, event, campaign, or product."</p>
    <p>Among other things, graphic design can be used by enterprises to brand themselves, by websites to present complex information in an understandable fashion, and by businesses to advertise and sell their products. It's also critical to keep in mind that, despite the fact that many graphic design projects serve commercial objectives like creating logos and advertisements, graphic design is frequently used in other contexts and produced purely for artistic expression.</p>

    <h3>Types of graphic design</h3>
    <p>As previously stated, there is no single graphic design meaning. Graphic design encompasses a wide range of disciplines and specializations, from print and web design to animation and motion graphics. Graphic design provides opportunities and options for people with almost any interest.</p>
    <p>Some of the most notable modern-day graphic design examples stem from advancements in technology. Here’s a glimpse of some of these types of graphic design:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Website design. </strong>It involves creating user-friendly and engaging web pages. The overall layout, color scheme, and navigation are all part of this.</li>
        <li><strong>User experience (UX) design. </strong>It is concerned with making a website or application simple and enjoyable to use. These designers place a premium on value, usability, adaptability, and desirability.</li>
        <li><strong>Motion graphics design or animation. </strong>Visual elements are brought to life through special effects, TV shows, video games, and movies.</li>
    </ul>
<br>
<br>
<h3>COMMON GRAPHIC DESIGN JOBS</h3>
<p>New graphic design occupations have appeared as a result of the introduction of new types of graphic design by technical breakthroughs. The entire landscape of careers in this industry has transformed as a result of this evolution.</p>
<p>There has been a significant decline in the demand for "traditional" graphic designers who primarily serve print publishers, but that doesn't fully explain the situation. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), employment of graphic designers in computer systems design services is expected to increase by 24 percent through 2028.1 A significant portion of this demand is driven by businesses' and organizations' increased demand for digital graphics and imagery as they work to increase their digital presence.</p>
<p>What are some typical job titles for graphic designers, then? Over the previous year, we looked at more than 30,000 job advertisements that required a graphic design degree. The information allowed us to identify the following positions as the most prevalent ones:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Graphic designer</li>
    <li>User experience (UX) designer</li>
    <li>Web Designer</li>
    <li>Art director</li>
    <li>Creative director</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there are many opportunities for graphic design careers provided you have the necessary education and experience. Your career can be tailored to fit your unique abilities and interests.</p>
